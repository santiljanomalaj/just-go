        <h6 class="item-list-title">27.	Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>(a)	Disputes</p>
            <p>Just Go is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other user, any Contractor or merchant, or other third party. Disputes between you and Just Go are subject to this Section. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>(b)	Arbitration</p>
            <p>You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services as a User of the Services, to any advertising or marketing communications regarding Just Go or the Services, to any products or services sold or distributed through the Services that you received as a User of our Services, or to any aspect of your relationship or transactions with Just Go as a User of our Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND JUST GO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>(c)	Exceptions</p>
            <p>Despite the provisions of the paragraph directly above, we both agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (1) Bring an individual action in small claims court; (2) Pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; or (3) File suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>(d)	Arbitrator</p>
            <p>Any arbitration between you and Just Go shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (collectively, “JAMS Rules”), as modified by these Terms, and administered by JAMS. The JAMS Rules and fee information are available at www.jamsadr.org or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. The arbitrator is bound by these arbitration terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 13.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>(e)	Notice Process</p>
            <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the Dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").</p>
            <p>Just Go’s address for Notice is: Michael Antonovich, 430 S Garfield Ave #428 Alhambra CA 91801, Tel: 818-913-8083; email: help@justgodelivery.com</p>
            <p>The Notice must: (1) Describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) Set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").</p>
            <p>We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Just Go may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Just Go must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>(f)	Fees</p>
            <p>If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, you will be required to pay $250 to initiate the arbitration. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Just Go will pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>
            <p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America. You and Just Go further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Orange County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. If a claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (1) Solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; or (2) Through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.</p>
            <p>If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Just Go for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p>
            <p>The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>(g)	No Class or Representative Actions</p>
            <p>YOU AND JUST GO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
            <p>Further, unless both you and Just Go agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that this “No Class or Representative Actions” section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class or representative basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>(h)	30-Day Right to Opt Out</p>
            <p>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by submitting a request here. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your creating an account with Just Go or the effective date of the first set of Terms containing a Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Just Go also will not be bound by them. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SUPERSEDE, AMEND, OR MODIFY THE TERMS OF ANY SEPARATE AGREEMENT(S) BETWEEN YOU AND JUST GO RELATING TO YOUR WORK AS AN EMPLOYEE OR USE OF THE PLATFORM AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FLEET AGREEMENT) GOVERNING YOUR SERVICES AS A CONTRACTOR. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, IF YOU ARE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, OPTING OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL NOT AFFECT ANY AGREEMENT BY YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES COVERED BY YOUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FLEET AGREEMENT) WITH JUST GO.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>(i)	Modifications</p>
            <p>Except for inconsequential changes that do not affect any rights or obligations herein, Just Go will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Site and Application sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Site and Application or sent to you, or otherwise notified when you are logged into your account. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Modifications" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Dispute Resolution and Arbitration,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section in existence after you began using the Platform. You may otherwise reject the change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Just Go’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Just Go will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive.</p>
